From psychedelic rock to stoner, sometimes touching on heavier metal influences.<br></br>During my two years in Rennes, this passion came to life through an album project with three musician friends: Hugo, Charles, and Adrien. Together, we crafted a sound that reflects who we are, blending progressive rock, psychedelia, and heavier sonic journeys."
