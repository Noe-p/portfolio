Over there, it's almost too easy ‚Äî the landscapes are stunning at every turn."

        "text": "Before heading to New Zealand, I was studying for a Master's degree in Digital Project Management in Rennes, through a work-study program. I specialized in fullstack development and gained hands-on experience across the entire web production pipeline. Originally, I wanted to become a math teacher. I loved the logic, structure, and elegance of mathematics, but I was looking for something more tangible. Coding became the perfect balance between technical skills, logic, and creativity."

It was an incredibly valuable experience within a close-knit team."

To me, these creative disciplines blend perfectly with coding ‚Äî they all require precision, attention to detail, and imagination. And after hours spent in front of a screen, swimming and climbing are my go-to activities to stay balanced and energized."
