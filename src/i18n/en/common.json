It was also a great opportunity to improve my English (it needed some work, let's be honest) and dive into photography. Over there, it's almost too easy ‚Äî the landscapes are stunning at every turn."

        "text": "Before heading to New Zealand, I was studying for a Master's degree in Digital Project Management in Rennes, through a work-study program. I specialized in fullstack development and gained hands-on experience across the entire web production pipeline. Originally, I wanted to become a math teacher. I loved the logic, structure, and elegance of mathematics, but I was looking for something more tangible. Coding became the perfect balance between technical skills, logic, and creativity."

I worked on a variety of projects using stacks like Next.js and Nest.js, explored many different libraries, communicated with clients, and managed projects from start to finish. It was an incredibly valuable experience within a close-knit team."

        "text": "Outside of development, I'm deeply passionate about music and photography. I love composing, playing in bands, exploring sound, and capturing moments through a lens. To me, these creative disciplines blend perfectly with coding ‚Äî they all require precision, attention to detail, and imagination. And after hours spent in front of a screen, swimming and climbing are my go-to activities to stay balanced and energized."
